# world_scaling kinematic round-trip for a SCALE pin op about an
# ABSOLUTE pivot, world_scaling=10. The pin SCALE factor is
# dimensionless (a ratio), but its pivot is a world-space length and is
# scaled on ingest (scene.rs). A vertex scaled about that pivot is a
# length and round-trips through scale-in / scale-out. The solver
# trajectory must match the scale-agnostic frontend reference,
# confirming the pin-scale pivot scales with the geometry.

# NOT ON WINDOWS, WHICH RUNS THE RIG HEADLESS AND SO HAS NO MODAL LOOP.
#
# This scenario needs a Blender that owns a window: the PC2 it asserts on is
# written by `PPF_OT_FramePump.modal` AFTER the driver's exec returns, and a
# modal operator needs an event loop to run in. Measured on the Windows leg of
# Blender CI: the driver reached `fetched queued=9 total=9`, the probe recorded
# `modal_seen: []`, and the scenario finished with ZERO checks and no error,
# because nothing it asserts on had been written yet. The drawing scenarios in
# the same set fail one step earlier and say so outright, with "GPU functions
# for drawing requires the gpu module to be initialized".
#
# Two requirements collide here: a full build/run/fetch scenario must NOT be
# run with `--background`, because the modal operator above needs an event
# loop, and the Windows leg of CI has no window server, so it runs headless.
# There is no configuration in which both hold, so this declares where it can
# run rather than failing there every time. Linux gives the rig its own Xvfb
# and macOS has a real window server.
